The Simon Game 
It is a classic electronic game of memory skill. It's named after the children's game Simon Says because of its similarity to the game's rules. The game was first manufactured and released by Milton Bradley in 1978.

How to Play:
Game Setup: The Simon Game consists of four colored buttons: red, blue, green, and yellow. The game randomly generates a sequence of colors and plays it for the player.

Gameplay:

The game starts with a single color lighting up and a corresponding sound playing.
The player must repeat the sequence by pressing the same color.
After the player successfully repeats the sequence, the game adds another random color to the sequence, making it longer.
